# My Personal Site
The code in this repo is for my personal site located at [http://mcdonnelldean.me](). The site is built using
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and hosted on [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

## Running
The site can be ran locally using the following steps:

- Download the repo and navigate to the root folder
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start dev`

The development server is 'hot' and will reload on any changes. The lib folder is bundled by webpack, in order
to update the bundle you will need to run `webpack --watch` in a separate window.
