# [Maker][maker] / Projects
A collection of hardware projects I have completed. These are not so much guides as documentation. However they may prove a great insperation either as whole projects to replicate or as examples of using various components and boards together.

Each project comes with an overview, parts and library list, as well as a small gallery and a breakdown section which goes over each major component, part or circuit.
